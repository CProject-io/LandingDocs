# C-Project: Official Repository

Welcome to the official repository of C-Project. This repository is the cornerstone of C-Project's documentation and governance, housing all the necessary information, guidelines, and resources for contributors, developers, and community members.

## 🧬 What is C-Project?
C-Project is an open-source blockchain initiative that aims to revolutionize the energy sector through a novel Proof of Generation (PoG) consensus mechanism. By leveraging renewable energy generation as a validation method, C-Project promotes sustainability, reduces carbon footprints, and creates a decentralized, secure, and transparent ecosystem for energy infrastructure, DeFi, and beyond.

* **Verifiable Sustainability:** Employs a novel Proof-of-Generation (PoG) consensus whose integrity is guaranteed through a robust multi-layer validation mechanism, combining direct energy measurement with contextual and environmental data to ensure the veracity of reported generation (see [Architecture](📁 docs/architecture.html)).

## 🌍 Our Philosophy
C-Project is driven by a vision of environmental sustainability, technological innovation, and community empowerment. We believe in the power of open-source collaboration to solve global challenges. Our approach emphasizes transparency, inclusivity, and a meritocratic governance model where every contribution counts.
