# C-Project Initial Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundations and Planning

- **Definition of Vision and Mission:**
  - Clearly establish the objectives of C-Project, focusing on creating a self-sustaining blockchain infrastructure that serves as a platform for IT solutions.

- **Formation of the Initial Team:**
  - Recruit developers, engineers, scientists, and economists committed to the project's vision.

- **Research and Analysis:**
  - Study similar projects, such as DECODE, to identify best practices and potential challenges.
  - Analyze existing blockchain technologies to determine the most suitable for our objectives.

- **Development of the Project Plan:**
  - Develop a detailed plan that includes timelines, required resources, and risk mitigation strategies.

## Phase 2: Development of Basic Infrastructure

- **System Architecture Design:**
  - Define the structure of the blockchain network, including nodes, consensus mechanisms, and communication protocols.

- **Development of the PoG (Proof of Generation) Protocol:**
  - Implement and test the consensus mechanism that will incentivize renewable energy generation within the network.

- **Development of the Client Node:**
  - Create the software that will allow participants to connect and operate within the blockchain network.

- **Implementation of Security Mechanisms:**
  - Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the network by implementing robust security protocols.

## Phase 3: Pilot Testing and Validation

- **Deployment of Test Networks (Testnets):**
  - Launch controlled environments to evaluate the performance and security of the network.

- **Stress and Security Testing:**
  - Subject the network to extreme conditions to identify and correct potential vulnerabilities.

- **Feedback and Continuous Improvement:**
  - Gather feedback from early users and make adjustments as necessary.

** Phase 4: PoG Evolution & Native Weather Data Services**
    * **Description:** Development and optional integration of weather station modules into C-Project nodes.
    * **Objectives:**
        * Utilize hyper-local, real-time climate data (measured by the node itself) to dramatically increase the accuracy and security of PoG validation.
        * Reduce reliance on external oracles for environmental data.
        * Position the C-Project network as a decentralized provider of granular climate data, generating new utility and value for the ecosystem.

## Phase 5: Application Development and Community Expansion

- **Promotion of dApp Development:**
  - Encourage the creation of decentralized applications that add value to the network and its users.

- **Education and Training Programs:**
  - Offer resources and workshops to educate the community on the use and development within C-Project.

- **Marketing Strategies and Partnerships:**
  - Promote the project on various platforms and establish strategic collaborations to expand the network's reach.

## Phase 6: Official Launch and Creation of Internal Economy

- **Launch of the Main Network (Mainnet):**
  - Put the official version of the network into operation for all users.

- **Implementation of the Token Economy:**
  - Establish an internal economic system that rewards participants and ensures the project's sustainability.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Optimization:**
  - Monitor the network's performance and make improvements as necessary to adapt to the changing needs of the community.
