# Contribution Guidelines (ðŸ“œ CONTRIBUTING.md)

- All contributions should follow the repository's branching strategy (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`).
- Submit pull requests (PRs) with clear descriptions and reference related issues when applicable.
- Contributions must pass CI/CD checks and be reviewed by at least 2 members.
- Use Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`).
